# Enhanced Shopping Experience with Visual AI

## Introduction

Think about the iconic yellow saree worn by Kajol in *Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge* or the stylish sunglasses sported by Ranveer Singh in *Gully Boy*. These Bollywood movies, available on Amazon Prime, have set significant fashion trends in India and beyond. Yet, while AI is revolutionizing various sectors, its potential in enhancing our shopping experiences remains largely untapped.

Our project aims to bridge this gap by leveraging visual AI technology to improve product search, recommendations, and item identification in text, images, or video content. By extending the X-ray feature from Amazon Prime Video, we enable users to identify and directly purchase items featured in video content, such as furniture, clothing, and other products. This integration of AI and e-commerce creates a seamless, personalized, and engaging shopping experience.

## Features

1. **Real-Time Object Detection in Videos**:
    - Users can upload videos and get real-time detection of various objects.
    - Detected objects are highlighted with bounding boxes and labeled with their respective names.

2. **Product Recommendations**:
    - Each detected object is linked to relevant products on Amazon.
    - Users can click on these links to view and purchase similar items.

3. **Enhanced Search Functionalities**:
    - Improve search accuracy and relevance by integrating visual recognition with traditional text-based search.
    - Personalized product recommendations based on detected items in the userâ€™s content.

## Project Structure

- **HTML/CSS**: Frontend interface for video upload, playback, and displaying detection results.
- **JavaScript**: Handles video processing, object detection, and communication with the Web Worker.
- **Web Worker**: Offloads heavy computations to a separate thread to keep the UI responsive.
- **ONNX Runtime for WebAssembly**: Runs the YOLOv8 model for object detection within the Web Worker.
